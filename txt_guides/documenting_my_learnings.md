## Layout Guidelines
- **Card/Grid Layout**  
  - Each board represented as a **card** with:  
    - Thumbnail screenshot (from Miro).  
    - Board name (title).  
    - Source (book/framework).  
    - Short description (1–2 lines).  
    - “View Board →” button linking to the live Miro board.  
- **Consistency:** Keep all thumbnails in the same aspect ratio.  
- **Interaction:** Hover effect should enlarge the card or highlight the “View Board” button.

## Placement & Styling
- **Position:** After *Hobbies & Interests* or as a standalone *Learning Hub*.  
- **Design:** Clean, minimal styling with light backgrounds, so the Miro board visuals stand out.  
- **Typography:**  
  - Board title → bold, medium-large (18px–20px).  
  - Source → smaller, muted text (14px).  
  - Description → regular body font.  
- **Icons:** Use light educational or book icons to signal learning.
